##Learn Express Lecture and Homework

***This repo contains my solution to the following exercises:***

###Homework

* Write code using `readFileSync()` to count the number of new line characters in a given file.  The user should supply the file name as an argument when running the script.  For example:

    Given the following `test.txt` file:

    ```
    hello
    blah blah
    goodbye
    ```
    Running `node newLineCount.js test.txt` should print out 2.

* Rewrite the above code using `readFile()`
* Use the HTTP module to make a request to "http://omdbapi.com/?i=tt0241527" and store the data in an array.  Once the first request is finished, make another request to "http://omdbapi.com/?i=tt0295297" and add the data to the same array.  When the second request is finished, console.log the array with the data.  Callbacks!!!
